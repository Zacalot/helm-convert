# helm-convert.el
Helm-based unit converter interface for Emacs. Uses the build-in calc-units package to perform the actual conversions.

My first Emacs addition, written several months ago for learning and utility. Its code may be messy and I wouldn't be surprised if it has bugs, but it has worked to my needs for the longest while now so maybe you can find it useful too. Feel free to do whatever you want with it.

# custom-units.el

This is optional and just adds some extra units.
